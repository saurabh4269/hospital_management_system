# Problem Statement

Manage unpredictable surges in patients during festivals, pollution spikes, or epidemics with an AI agent that autonomously analyzes data and recommends staffing, supply, and patient advisory actions in advance.

# Solution Overview

Our solution is a multi-modal AI system that forecasts hospital patient surges 3–14 days in advance by integrating open-source and API-based data streams from EHRs, environmental sensors tracking AQI and weather, festival and mobility data, and regional public health records. The predictive layer combines holiday-aware time-series models such as Prophet or NeuralProphet with gradient-boost ensembles like XGBoost to capture nonlinear interactions between pollution, climate, and social factors. Spatial interdependence across regions is modeled through a lightweight graph framework: hospitals are represented as nodes connected by mobility or referral edges, and local surge signals are propagated using k-nearest graph diffusion to estimate epidemic spillover and cross-district demand shifts. Forecast outputs drive a resource-optimization layer formulated as a mixed-integer program that recommends adaptive staffing, inventory adjustments, and dynamic bed allocation while satisfying operational and logistical constraints. An autonomous orchestration agent built with LangChain coordinates these modules, interpreting surge predictions, generating staff schedules, triggering supply actions, and composing context-aware advisories through LLMs (from API endpoints, like OpenAI). A minimal web dashboard visualizes forecast trajectories, spatial transmission maps, and recommended interventions, creating a coherent decision-support loop that transforms fragmented hospital data into actionable intelligence for proactive, data-driven surge management.
